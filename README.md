Aegis is an open-source security tool that uses your PC's camera to deliver face recognition, face detection, and motion detection. Developed with a focus on efficiency, it combines the performance of **Rust** with the flexibility of **Python** to create a lightweight yet powerful system.

---

*What Aegis Is Not*

- A software designed to run on your primary PC: Aegis is intended to run on dedicated servers or older PCs, repurposing them for security purposes. 
- A multi-system network solution: This software is designed to operate on one or two PCs at most.

---

*Current Capabilities:*

- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes and matches faces, enabling identification and tracking.
- **Face Detection**: Detects the presence of faces in the camera's frame.
- **Motion Detection**: Tracks movement in real-time.

*Upcoming Additions:*

- **Sleep Mode**: Reduces system usage by pausing operations when no motion or faces are detected.
- **UI for Monitoring**: A web interface running on `localhost` to actively monitor the camera's feed and manage settings.
- **Further Optimization**: Enhancements to make the software even more resource-efficient.

---

**Technology Stack**

- **Rust** for high-performance operations and memory safety.
- **Python** for advanced AI capabilities and extensibility.

This combination ensures a balance between speed, stability, and ease of development.

**Compatibility**

Works on Linux and Windows. Actively tested on **Ubuntu** and **Windows 11**. Compatibility with macOS is uncertain.
